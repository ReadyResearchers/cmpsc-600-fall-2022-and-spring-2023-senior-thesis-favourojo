# Introduction

## History of Pittsburgh Black Population


Few places held as much promise for the huge numbers of African Americans fleeing the South in the years following the Civil War as the thriving city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Black people flocked to Pittsburgh, particularly to the Hill District, hoping to find work in the steel and railroad industries and escape the Jim Crow segregationist laws of the Reconstruction-era South. This was during the time period when Pittsburgh had a very booming steel manufacturing industry. 


The Hill District was a neighborhood close to downtown but up against steep hills, making it an unattractive place for the city's upper classes to live. In the Hill District, a city-within-a-city that was acknowledged by the 1930s as the center of black culture and commerce, African Americans established close-knit communities. The Negro League Pittsburgh Crawfords, one of the best baseball teams in the country, played in the comunnity at Greenlee Field, the first black-owned and black-build baseball stadium in America. It was also home to one of the most active jazz scenes in the nation. 
  

However, as the century went on, the neighborhood's decaying infrastructure cast a shadow over it. Regardless of whether the Lower Hill District's structures need restoration, the city decided to demolish them in 1956 to make room for the construction of the new Civic Arena. Over the subsequent five years, this resulted in the eviction of 8,000 inhabitants, further causing overcrowding in the Middle and Upper Hill areas. This led to the loss of much of the city's cultural vitality and significantly changed how the Hill is today.


After these events, the city of Pittsburgh, as a whole, suffered through a period of economic decline as the city would start to lose their number of jobs and residents to the suburbs and to overseas. Though they faced hardship, the African-American population in Pittsburgh would continue to grow, reaching to about 12% in 1950. However, that would not stop the rampant unfair employment practices and barriers they would have to overcome to live where they wanted to live. Black unemployment was more than twice as high as white unemployment from the early 1950s to the early 1960s, and wealth disparities were pervasive. Even though the city passed a fair employment practices legislation in 1953, approximately 25% of all discrimination complaint cases across the states were filled with the Pittsburgh area office. 

## Policing in Pittsburgh


The Pittsburgh Police Department's budget has risen from a budget of $74 million to $115 million from the years 2014 to 2021, an almost 60% in 7 years. One-fifth of the city's annual budget is represented by this figure. Because of this, many individuals in the Pittsburgh region conveyed the wish to cut the police budget by at least $40 million in order to invest the money elsewhere in the community. 

![Pittsburgh Police Budget Graph](images/budget.png)

The figure visualizes the statistic of the police bureau receiving one-fifth of Pittsburgh's operating budget, which is the largest percentage in over six years. Within this image, one can see how the police budget steadily increases by every year, no sign of decrease. 


Inside the Pittsburgh City Paper, Lauryn Nania writes an article discussing the call for the decrease in police  funding and an increase in community investment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In this article, she discusses comments made at a news conference conducted by the Coalition to Reimagine Public Safety. Nanaia recounts a statement Jasiti X, founder of 1Hood Media, made when examining the structural and institutionalized violence that minority groups experience and the fact that these problems frequently lead to violent crimes. The problem cannot be handled if these communities lack the necessary resources. Jarisi X exemplifies his point by saying, "Violence is far more than just crime. Violence is an experience that limits or diminishes people's capacity to survive. Unemployment, inadequate housing, lack of access to medical care, subpar public education systems, food insecurity, and racism are all violence." [7] 


With this, individuals are concerned with the increase in police funding when problems within community investment continue to be neglected. According to a 2020 research by the Abolitionist Law Center, there were significant disparities in how Black and white were treated by police in Pittsburgh in 2019. This information was highlighted by the Coalition to Reimagine Public Safety in Lauryn Nania's article. The Abolitionist Law Center report states, "Black people made up only 23.2% of the Pittsburgh population, and yet they made up 43.6% of individuals involved in traffic stops, 71.4% of all frisks, 69% of individuals subject to warrantless search and seizures, and 63% of all arrests conducted by the Pittsburgh Police." [7]


When it comes to children, the disparities were even more vast: Black children accounted for 83% of all warrantless search and seizures of individuals ages 11-18 and 100% of all warrantless search and seizures of children ages 10 and under.
[7] These statistics illustrates the effect of the increasing crime prevention rather than analyzing the aspects of what could displace a community. Even with these statistics, Mayor Bill Peduto has resisted calls to dramatically reduce the police budget, arguing that while it has grown, general crime has fallen. Individuals within the community believe with an uprising in interactions with police that end in death such as Antown Ross II and Bruce Kelly Jr., policing can be replaced with required and immediate alternatives. 

## Relationship between Citizens and Police

George Floyd's death and other instances of police brutality have sparked national calls for police reform and elevaed public oversight of law enforcement to the top of the agenda in legislative discussions. Because of these instances, residents are starting feel frightful when around the presence of law enforcement, rather than protected. Local eleceted authorities are moving to establish and broaden civilian supervision, including a recent proposal for referendum to improve Pittsburgh's Citizen Police Review Board (CRPB) and renewed efforts to establish a county wide boad. 

However, some residents are hesistant to a citizen police review board primarily because they believe it was not be successful towards the pursuit of police reform. The varying opinions about citizen review boards by residents of Pittsburgh ranges from individuals believing that the boards can lessen prejudice in officer investigations and increase public trust in the police to boards frequently fail to conduct full investigations and impose discipline. Juliette Rihl and Mitra Nourbakhsh, the authors of "Who polices the police? In Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, a critical crossroads for civilian review", use stastics to assess the effectiveness of a citizen police review board in Pittsburgh, "Between 1998 and 2017, 3% of the more than 3,000 complaints CPRP received resulted in public hearings, one of the final stages of the board's process...Across that time period, Pittsburgh's police chiefs fully rejected many of CPRB's recommendations" [11]. This stat highlights the disconnect between the police department in Pittsburgh and their citizens. Though citizens are voicing their opinions on how policing in conducted in their city, the police department refuses to properly address these issues. They chose to classify them as a non-essential matter. 

## Gun Violence in Pittsburgh 


According to recent study by county researchers, homicides in Allegheny County are disproportionately concentrated in a small number of high-need regions and disproportionately affect young Black men. Since the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Pittsburgh and Allegheny County's homicide rate has spiked since the initial decline. The researchers who conducted the specific study spoke about the results, "All people, regardless of race or socio-economic status, deserve to live in neighborhoods that are safe and free of violence,...violence is heavily concentrated in just a small number of higher-need communities and overwhelmingly cuts short the lives of young Black men". [2] The analysis made by the researchers shows the disadvantage higher-need communities have compared to other communities in Allegheny County, specifically the suburban communities, due to how violence has become normalized. 


Though there is evidence that gun violence has become assimilated into predominantly Black communities, there still exists a lack of action towards addressing the gun violence issue and lessening the homicide rate. The eastern city neighborhoods of East Hills, Homewood, Larimer, and Lincoln-Lemington, along with a few more on the upper North Side, Hill District, South Hilltop, and West End, as well as Wilkinsburg, a part of Penn Hills, villages in the Mon Valley, are where most homicides occur.


Homicides occur in a very small percentage of Allegheny County's census blocks, and 79% of those blocks are located in regions with moderate to severe levels of "community need", which the researchers gauge by looking at statistics on poverty and other factors


![Homicide Hot Spots in Allegheny County](images/violence.png)


The map above visualizes six years of homicides that have taken place in Allegheny County, additionally non-fatal shootings in Pittsburgh. The figure focuses on the city of Pittsburgh neighborhoods and also Allegheny County municipalities outside Pittsburgh.According to the legend located at the bottom of the figure, the coloring represents if the instances of homicidies are either more sparse or more dense in a certain community. Evidently, homicide seems to occurr more frequently around the Eastern region of Pittsburgh, where the residents are primarily Black. 

## Motivation

The current metro area population in 2022 stands as 1,699,000.[4] Statistically, the racial composition of Pittsburgh in the year of 2022 is 66.37% White, 24% Black or African American, 5.83% Asian, and 0.3% Latino. 


![Racial Composition of Pittsburgh](images/race.png)


The graph illustrates the different races in Pittsburgh per the percentage in total population. The figure shows that the majority of the population in Pittsburg identify as white compared to the other races present. 


Within the semi-diverse community of Pittsburgh, there was a clear displacement between the neighborhoods, whether one 
was speaking about the suburban communities or the urban communities. In both the suburban and urban communities in Pittsburgh, PA, the percentage of white people is more than 82%. Inside these primarily white communities, the Black population percentage stands as 9.8%.

![Trend in Pittsburgh's Metropolitan Population](images/population.png)


The figure above illustrates a line plot of the city of Pittsburgh's historical population from the 1950s to the 2000s, while depicting a second plot of the annual change in Pittsburgh's population. This figure also shows the United Nation's projections of what the metro population of Pittsburgh will be in 2030. One can see how there is gradual increase around the 1950s, and then a clear decrease occurs around the 1990s. After these evident changes, the population of Pittsburgh around the 2000s stays stagnant.


If one would compare these differing communities, the statistics would show how the Black and Brown communities are economically disadvantaged and more vulnerable to displacement. In actuality, issues within displacement represent the negative aspect of enduring poverty and segregation/exclusion. According to the Pittsburgh Neighborhood Project, due to deliberate actions taken at the federal, state, and municipal levels that deprived poor Black and Brown neighborhoods of investment, along with the consequences of white flight, outmigration, and de-industrialization, our poorest communities are as destitute as they are. [3]

![Economic disparties between Black and white communities](images/poverty.png)


The figure here shows the percentage of poor white and black residents living in high or extreme poverty neighborhoods in Pittsburgh according to the 2017 American Community survey estimates. Evidently, there is a higher percentage of Black resident living in high or extreme poverty. 



## Current State of the Art

Currently, there have been several kinds of actions taken to control housing development throughout Pittsburgh. Since the early 1990s, organizations and/or corporations have started to notice the neighborhood development crisis continue to worsen in Pittsburgh, and city officials continuing to leave  this plight unnoticed. Each of these organizations thrive to see the displacement of different Pittsburgh neighbrhoods be eradicted in the upcoming years. 


For instance, the Pittsburgh Housing Development Corporation (PHDC) was founded with the intention of initating, planning, financing, devloping, and managing Pittsburgh's housing construction. After realizing that neither the private development market nor neighborhood community development corporations were adequately serving significant portions of the city and county, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) established the Pittsburgh Housing Development Corporation (PHDC) in 1994. The goal of PHDC was to promote the expansion of, and never supplant, organization that can create both inexpensive and/or market-rate housing. With an organization like the PHDC, there is more attention directed to the neighborhoods that require investment and/or development. Since its founding, PHDC has been involved in the creation of almsot 350 units across the city, including market-rate new construction, affordable single family for sale new construction, single family rehabilitation projects, and multifamily rental complexes. 


Another example is the Neighborhood Community Development Fund, which was formerly knows as the "Northside Community Devlopment Fund". They are a more than 20-year old, neighborhood-focused community loan fund based in Pittsburgh's Northside. Their mission is to assure that the neighborhoods who need it will receive the economic opportunits and community revitalization to thrive. While also providing resources, they aid disadvantaged neighborhoods by creating affordable housing and leading the redevelopment of the neighborhoods in Allegheny County. Specifically, these ventures should include opportunies of for all the members of the community, women, people of color, and people of different ancestries. According to the Neighborhood Community Development Fund website, since their founding, they have been able to accomplish 399 loans funded, 1,336 jobs created, and 70 affordable houses financed. [9]


## Goals of the Project

There are marginalized communities almost everywhere. They are persons who are excluded from participating in popular economic, political, cultural, and social activities for a variety of reasons. The goal of this project is to shed light on the effect marginalization has had on these Black and Brown communities. Though there is not a clear solution for marginalization at the moment, there can be steps made to acknowledge the affected individuals, and thus aid in their need for community investment. In fact, there are several benefits to tackling marginalization for the United States of America's economy. 


The economic prosperity of communities and the entire nation might be significantly increased by marginalized groups, such as ex-offenders and low-income communities, but they require support from the commercial, public, and social sectors. Concerning those who were previously incarcerated, more opportunities for newly released prisoners to enter the workforce are required. Thus, it opens up avenues for these individuals to re-build their lives and start providing for themselves and also the economy.
 

While also providing opportunities for ex-convicts, individuals should also focus their attention on delivering services to those who most need them. People who are having a hard time financially need assistance, but they are frequently too overburdened by work, family, and other commitments to ask for it. 


## Ethical Implications

Regarding data science, there are pre-cautions individuals should take when completing projects take require data collection. The ability to access enormous amounts of data has profound effects on society. The human population has the potential to solve more problems and do more than ever before due to technology breakthroughs. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that law, ethics, and the concepts of privacy, trust, and security are all intertwined. 


Data collection, in general, mandataes several ethical considerations to be taken. For example, acquiring permission to use or share data, receiving clear and informed consent, and securely keeping data. Since this project relies heavily on data, there is a concern about information accuracy. To mitigate this harm, I have been carefully processing through the data sets I have acquired to ensure the data collected was not tampered with / has incorrect data. 

It is crucial to have defined procedures for data sharing in addition to having clear processes in palce for data collection.
