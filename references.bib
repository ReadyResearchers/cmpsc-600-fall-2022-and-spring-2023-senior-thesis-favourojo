  abstract = {The question of how best to improve neighborhoods that lag behind has drawn considerable attention from policy-makers, practitioners, and academics, yet there remains a vigorous debate regarding the best approaches to accomplish community development. This paper investigates the role crime policy plays in shaping the trajectory of neighborhoods. Much of the existing research on neighborhood crime was conducted in rising-crime environments, and the evidence was clear: high levels of crime have adverse effects on neighborhoods and resident quality of life. This study examines how private investment in neighborhoods in two cities – Chicago and Los Angeles – changed as the incidence of neighborhood crime changed during the 2000s, a period when crime was declining city-wide in both places. Using detailed blockface-level data on the location of crime and private investments between 2006 and 2011, the analysis answers the question: Do changes in crime affect private development decisions? The results show that private investment, as represented by building permits, decreases on blocks where crime increases in the past year. We also find that the relationship between crime and private investment is not symmetric – private investment appears to only be sensitive to crime in rising crime contexts. The result is present in both cities, and robust to multiple definitions of crime and the elimination of outliers and the main commercial district. These results suggest that crime-reduction policies can be an effective economic development tool, but only in certain neighborhoods facing specific circumstances.}

  abstract = {This study asks whether deficiencies in transportation are associated with disproportionate policing in Chicago using the case of cycling. I examine how the number of bicycle citations issued per street segment are influenced by the availability of bicycle facilities and street characteristics, controlling for crash incidence, police presence, and neighborhood characteristics. Tickets were issued 8 times more often per capita in majority Black tracts and 3 times more often in majority Latino tracts compared to majority white tracts. More tickets were issued on major streets, but up to 85% fewer were issued when those streets had bike facilities, which were less prevalent in Black and Latino neighborhoods. Tickets were not associated with bicycle injury-crashes and inversely associated with vehicle injury-crashes. Infrastructure inequities compound the effects of racially-biased policing in the context of transportation safety strategies. Remedies include the removal of traffic enforcement from safe systems strategies and equitable investment in cycling.}

  abstract = {This study examined the effect of neighborhood investments on neighborhood walkability, presence of incivilities, and crime in two low-income, primarily African American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, USA. During the study period, one of the neighborhoods (the intervention neighborhood) received substantially more publicly-funded investments than a demographically matched comparison neighborhood. Comparisons between the neighborhoods showed a significant difference-in-difference for all three outcomes. The intervention neighborhood experienced significantly more change related to improved walkability and decreased incivilities. However, the control neighborhood experienced better crime-related outcomes. Analyses that focused on resident proximity to investments found similar results. This highlights the nuances of neighborhood investment, which is important to consider when thinking about public policy.}

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to assess the relationship between residential crime and the built environment that reflects the principles of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) at the neighbourhood level. Using crime data for Seattle, this study investigated the effectiveness of CPTED principles associated with two different space design approaches (i.e., permeable space and defensible space) with respect to reducing residential crime. For the analysis, 1407 cases of residential crime (i.e., burglaries and robberies) were extracted from the Seattle crime incidents report. To identify the spatially unbiased distribution of residential crime, an area-standardized crime measure (i.e., crime density) was used in the analysis. The regression results showed that the proportion of the residential area, the average number of building storeys, bus-stop density, street density, and intersection density was significantly related to residential crime when the model was controlled for population density, neighbourhood median household income, and the distance of the neighbourhood from the closest police station. The findings indicated that land use diversity along with improved street connectivity has an adverse effect on prevention of residential crime. Increases in bus-stop density and street density in neighbourhoods were negatively related to residential crime. The study calls for the refinement of CPTED concepts to increase the discriminative controllability of potential crime attractors/generators and preventers in the neighbourhood.}
