		This study asks whether deficiencies in transportation are associated with
		disproportionate policing in Chicago using the case of cycling. I examine how
		the number of bicycle citations issued per street segment are influenced by
		the availability of bicycle facilities and street characteristics,
		controlling for crash incidence, police presence, and neighborhood
		characteristics. Tickets were issued 8 times more often per capita in
		majority Black tracts and 3 times more often in majority Latino tracts
		compared to majority white tracts. More tickets were issued on major streets,
		but up to 85% fewer were issued when those streets had bike facilities, which
		were less prevalent in Black and Latino neighborhoods. Tickets were not
		associated with bicycle injury-crashes and inversely associated with vehicle
		injury-crashes. Infrastructure inequities compound the effects of
		racially-biased policing in the context of transportation safety strategies.
		Remedies include the removal of traffic enforcement from safe systems
		strategies and equitable investment in cycling.

		This study examined the effect of neighborhood investments on neighborhood
		walkability, presence of incivilities, and crime in two low-income, primarily
		African American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, USA. During the study period,
		one of the neighborhoods (the intervention neighborhood) received
		substantially more publicly-funded investments than a demographically matched
		comparison neighborhood. Comparisons between the neighborhoods showed a
		significant difference-in-difference for all three outcomes. The intervention
		neighborhood experienced significantly more change related to improved
		walkability and decreased incivilities. However, the control neighborhood
		experienced better crime-related outcomes. Analyses that focused on resident
		proximity to investments found similar results. This highlights the nuances
		of neighborhood investment, which is important to consider when thinking
		about public policy.

	abstract     = {
		The question of how best to improve neighborhoods that lag behind has drawn
		considerable attention from policy-makers, practitioners, and academics, yet
		there remains a vigorous debate regarding the best approaches to accomplish
		community development. This paper investigates the role crime policy plays in
		shaping the trajectory of neighborhoods. Much of the existing research on
		neighborhood crime was conducted in rising-crime environments, and the
		evidence was clear: high levels of crime have adverse effects on
		neighborhoods and resident quality of life. This study examines how private
		investment in neighborhoods in two cities – Chicago and Los Angeles – changed
		as the incidence of neighborhood crime changed during the 2000s, a period
		when crime was declining city-wide in both places. Using detailed
		blockface-level data on the location of crime and private investments between
		2006 and 2011, the analysis answers the question: Do changes in crime affect
		private development decisions? The results show that private investment, as
		represented by building permits, decreases on blocks where crime increases in
		the past year. We also find that the relationship between crime and private
		investment is not symmetric – private investment appears to only be sensitive
		to crime in rising crime contexts. The result is present in both cities, and
		robust to multiple definitions of crime and the elimination of outliers and
		the main commercial district. These results suggest that crime-reduction
		policies can be an effective economic development tool, but only in certain
		neighborhoods facing specific circumstances.

	abstract     = {
		The objective of this paper is to assess the relationship between residential
		crime and the built environment that reflects the principles of crime
		prevention through environmental design (CPTED) at the neighbourhood level.
		Using crime data for Seattle, this study investigated the effectiveness of
		CPTED principles associated with two different space design approaches (i.e.,
		permeable space and defensible space) with respect to reducing residential
		crime. For the analysis, 1407 cases of residential crime (i.e., burglaries
		and robberies) were extracted from the Seattle crime incidents report. To
		identify the spatially unbiased distribution of residential crime, an
		area-standardized crime measure (i.e., crime density) was used in the
		analysis. The regression results showed that the proportion of the
		residential area, the average number of building storeys, bus-stop density,
		street density, and intersection density was significantly related to
		residential crime when the model was controlled for population density,
		neighbourhood median household income, and the distance of the neighbourhood
		from the closest police station. The findings indicated that land use
		diversity along with improved street connectivity has an adverse effect on
		prevention of residential crime. Increases in bus-stop density and street
		density in neighbourhoods were negatively related to residential crime. The
		study calls for the refinement of CPTED concepts to increase the
		discriminative controllability of potential crime attractors/generators and
		preventers in the neighbourhood.
