# Abstract

CriticalJustice visualizes factors in the determinants of crime and the relationship with infrastructure that affect neighborhood development. This research investigates the relationship of police dispatches to these community neighborhoods. This will be done explicitly by hypothesizing that rising infrastructure investment will improve the standard of living for the region's Black population. In predominantly Black communities, there appears to be an excess need for neighborhood development. Ergo, the attention desperately needed for neighborhood investment slowly starts to shift towards crime prevention. However, factors of a community, such as lack of infrastructure and over-policing, relate to why there is a difference in a demand of need between primarily Black and white communities.
