# Abstract

The tool, CriticalJustice, will visualize several factors in crime prevention that either positively or negatively affect neighborhood development. With the combination of marginalization and crime in a society, the need for crime prevention differs between primarily black communities and primarily white communities. In primarily Black communities, there is an excess need for neighborhood development, but it is overshadowed by the assumption that crime prevention should be the focus because of the high number of police dispatches in these communities compared to primarily white communities. Ergo, the attention desperately needed for neighborhood investment slowly starts to shift towards crime prevention. However, factors of a community, such as lack of infrastrcuture and over-policing, relate to why there is a difference in a demand of need between primarily Black and white communities.
