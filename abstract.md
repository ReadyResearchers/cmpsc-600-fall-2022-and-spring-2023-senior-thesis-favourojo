# Abstract

CriticalJustice visualizes factors in the determinants of crime and the relationship with infrastructure that affect neighborhood development. This research investigates the relationship of emergency dispatches and these community neighborhoods. This will be carried out specifically by speculating that increasing infrastructure investment disproportionately yields positive result for Black communities. in In predominantly Black communities, there appears to be an excess need for neighborhood development. Ergo, the attention desperately needed for neighborhood investment slowly starts to shift towards crime prevention. However, factors of a community, such as lack of infrastructure and over-policing, relate to why there is a difference in a demand of need between primarily Black and white communities.
